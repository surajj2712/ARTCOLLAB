ARTCOLLAB (ART-ECOMMERCE web application)

A PHP e-commerce web application.

1. To run this application, make sure PHP and PHPMyAdmin is installed on your server.
2. Next open PHPMyAdmin, create a database and import the bolt.sql file. This will generate tables in your database on your server.
3. The admin user which has been made has an email id sjobs@apple.com / admin@admin.com and the password is steve. (this can be confirmed in db or create one manually.)
5. Open config.php file and add the details of your PHPMyAdmin's id and password to access the database.
6. Once this is done, go to the url of your website (i.e localhost/file_name) and it should be up and running.

Currently only COD (Cash on Delivery), has been implemented. Stay tuned for the updates.
